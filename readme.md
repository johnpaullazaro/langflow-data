LeBron James - Complete Profile
Biography:
LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. Raised by his mother, Gloria James,
LeBron’s early life was defined by perseverance and determination. Despite financial hardships, his athletic ability
was apparent from childhood. Under the mentorship of Frank Walker, he discovered basketball and began playing
competitively at a young age. By middle school, LeBron was a regional standout, known for his strength, speed, and
high basketball IQ. Off the court, he has become a global icon, known for philanthropy and activism, most notably
founding the “I PROMISE School” in Akron to support underprivileged children.
High School:
LeBron attended St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, where his basketball career exploded into national prominence.
He led his team to three state championships and earned the title of Ohio’s “Mr. Basketball” three times. His games
drew national audiences, and at 17 he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as “The Chosen One.” With
averages over 30 points per game and unmatched versatility, he became the most hyped high school athlete ever.
Instead of college, he declared for the NBA Draft directly out of high school in 2003.
NBA Career:
Selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, LeBron instantly proved his worth, winning Rookie of the
Year in 2004. In 2010, he joined the Miami Heat, forming a “Big Three” with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. He won
two championships (2012, 2013) before returning to Cleveland in 2014, fulfilling his promise by leading the
Cavaliers to a historic 2016 championship. Joining the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018, he added another title in 2020.
A 19-time All-Star, 4-time MVP, and 4-time Finals MVP, LeBron is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, with over
39,000 career points. His combination of power, precision, and leadership has cemented him as one of the greatest
to ever play the game.
Shoes & Legacy:
LeBron signed a groundbreaking $90 million deal with Nike before his NBA debut, launching his first shoe, the Nike
Air Zoom Generation, in 2003. His signature line—now beyond 20 models—has pioneered performance technology
and cultural style. The LeBron 8 introduced Max Air cushioning, while later editions integrated Flyknit and
lightweight fibers. His lifetime Nike deal exceeds $1 billion, making him one of the most marketable athletes in
history. Beyond footwear, LeBron has built a vast empire: he co-founded SpringHill Company, invests in sports
franchises, and champions education and equality. His influence extends far beyond basketball—he is a symbol of
excellence, resilience, and empowerment worldwide
